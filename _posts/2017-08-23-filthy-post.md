#### Confusion

What should someone write in a blog? The idea of one's mental droppings being worth another's while is an odd one. But they are and I've gotten a lot out of them in the past. Maybe its that where I have droppings others have proper thoughts, fleshed out and well formed ideas. I guess the way is just to do it. Get something out there and later editand excise add and refine. Proofread too. Surely the mere act will cause something to happen. Like Hemmingway said, it's a numbers game and chance combined with effort and thought will produce something interesting given enough time. Or maybe it won't and thats why some fail. Again a numbers game. I'm not wont to fail as long as there's an output so lets give it some time and energy.
